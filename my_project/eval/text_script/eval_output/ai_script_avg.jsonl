Close your eyes if that feels comfortable, or soften your gaze downward.  \n\nBring your attention to your breath. Notice the air as it enters through your nostrils, cool and gentle.

Notice how it flows without force, like a quiet tide. <#2.0#>  \n\nAs you rest here, bring to mind a moment when you saw growth in someone you guided. Perhaps a student, a colleague, or someone whose journey you supported. Recall the spark in their eyes when they understood something new—the shift from uncertainty to confidence. <#3.0#>  \nFeel the warmth of that memory now. That moment when their breakthrough echoed your dedication. <#2.0#> You didn’t just share knowledge; you planted seeds of possibility. And witnessing them bloom? That’s where purpose lives. <#4.0#>  \n\nNotice the quiet pride swelling within you. Not from applause or achievement, but from knowing you helped someone find their footing. <#2.0#> Their progress became your compass—reminding you why you walk this path. <#3.0#>  \nBreathe into that fulfillment now. Let it settle in your chest like sunlight. This isn’t about changing the world all at once. It’s about the quiet impact of showing up, again and again. <#4.0#>  \n\nHear their voice saying, \"I get it now.\" Feel the resonance of their growth—how it mirrors your own commitment. <#2.0#> This is the gift teaching gives back: the profound certainty that your time, your energy, your care—it all matters. <#5.0#>  \n\nGently return your focus to your breath.

Find a position that feels supportive for you right now – perhaps seated comfortably in a chair, feet flat on the floor, or maybe sitting cross-legged on a cushion, or even lying down if that feels better. Gently rest your hands in your lap, palms open or one resting lightly on the other. Allow your shoulders to soften, just letting them drop away from your ears. <#0.5#> Let your jaw relax... unclench your teeth... soften your tongue... and gently close your eyes, or soften your gaze downwards if that's more comfortable.\n\nBegin by simply noticing the space you're in. Feel the support beneath you – the chair, the cushion, the floor. Notice the gentle rise and fall of your chest or your belly as you breathe. <#1.0#> There's nowhere else you need to be right now. Nothing else you need to fix. Just here, with your breath.\n\nNow, let's gently guide the breath for a few moments. <#0.5#> Slowly, gently, inhale through your nose... feeling the cool air enter... filling your lungs comfortably. <#1.0#> And then, softly exhale through your mouth... letting the warm air flow out... releasing tension as you breathe out. <#2.0#>\n\nAgain... <#0.5#> Inhale deeply through the nose... <#1.0#> Exhale slowly through the mouth... <#2.0#>\n\nOne more time... <#0.5#> A nourishing inhale through the nose... <#1.0#> A releasing exhale through the mouth... <#2.0#>\n\nGood. Now, let your breath return to its natural rhythm. No need to force it. Just observe it flowing in... and flowing out... like gentle waves on a shore. <#1.5#>\n\nIt’s completely understandable, friend, when things feel like they're crashing down around a crucial moment. That sharp pang of frustration when something essential stops working, right when you *need* it most. <#1.0#> That feeling of time pressing in, urgency tightening your chest, plans suddenly unraveling. Maybe it’s a machine refusing to cooperate, a vital piece of technology choosing the worst possible moment to fail. <#1.0#> That wave of helplessness when a quick fix isn't available, and the solution feels miles away. The gritting of teeth, the restless pacing, the heat rising... the feeling that everything is working against you. <#2.0#>\n\nNotice if any of that familiar tension is present in your body right now. <#0.5#> Maybe in your jaw, clenched tight? <#0.5#> Or your shoulders, hiked up near your ears? <#0.5#> Perhaps a tightness in your stomach, or fists wanting to ball up? <#1.5#> Just observe it. Don't judge it. Don't try to push it away. Acknowledge it. \"Ah, yes, there you are. Frustration. Urgency. Pressure.\" <#1.5#> Simply naming it can sometimes soften its sharp edges.\n\nImagine that frustrating situation, that broken piece of technology, that urgent need. Picture it clearly for just a moment. See the source of the blockage. <#1.0#>\n\nNow, imagine taking a step back. <#0.5#> Like stepping away from a screen that's glaring at you. <#0.5#> Or looking down at a map from high above. <#1.0#> See the obstacle itself – the malfunction, the delay. See it sitting there, separate from *you*. <#1.5#> It's a circumstance. An event. A thing that happened. It isn't *you*. It doesn't define your capability. <#2.0#>\n\nFeel the ground firmly supporting you beneath your seat or your feet. <#0.5#> Root down into that support. <#0.5#> With each gentle inhale, imagine drawing up a sense of steadiness from the earth itself. <#1.0#> With each soft exhale, imagine releasing some of that coiled tension, that hot frustration, that sense of racing against time... letting it flow out and away. <#2.0#>\n\nBreathe in... steadiness. <#1.0#> Breathe out... releasing the pressure. <#1.5#>\nBreathe in... presence. <#1.0#> Breathe out... letting go of the grip of urgency. <#1.5#>\nBreathe in... space. <#1.0#> Breathe out... softening the resistance. <#1.5#>\n\nThis obstacle, this disruption... it doesn't have to fill your entire world. <#1.0#> Like a cloud passing across the sky, it obscures the sun for a while, but the vast, open sky remains, unchanged. <#1.5#> You are that sky. Vast. Capable. Containing space for storms and clear weather alike. <#2.0#>\n\nNotice the quiet strength that resides within you, beneath the surface noise of irritation. <#1.0#> It's the same strength that has carried you through countless moments before. <#1.0#> Feel that inner resilience, like a deep, calm pool of water. <#1.5#> It might feel hidden by the ripples of frustration on the surface right now, but it is always there. <#2.0#>\n\nBring a gentle curiosity to this moment. <#0.5#> Instead of battling the obstacle, can you simply observe it? What does the frustration actually feel like in your body right *now*? Not the story about the printer, or the deadline, or the plan... but the physical sensation. <#2.0#> Is it heat? <#0.5#> Tightness? <#0.5#> A buzzing energy? <#1.0#> Observe it without needing it to change. <#1.5#> Often, when we stop fighting the feeling, it begins to shift on its own. <#2.0#>\n\nYou are so much more than this single moment of friction. <#1.0#> You contain patience you haven't tapped yet. <#0.5#> You contain resourcefulness. <#0.5#> You contain calm. <#1.0#> This obstacle is a challenge, yes, but it doesn't diminish your inherent capacity to navigate, to adapt, to find a way forward, even if the path looks different than you first imagined. <#2.0#>\n\nRest here for a few breaths, anchored in your body, connected to the support beneath you, aware of the calm strength that is your constant companion. <#3.0#>\n\nGently, begin to bring your awareness back to the physical space around you. <#0.5#> Notice the sounds in the room, near or far. <#0.5#> Feel the weight of your body where it meets the chair or cushion or floor. <#1.0#> Wiggle your fingers and toes slightly. <#0.5#>\n\nWhen you feel ready, slowly open your eyes, if they were closed. <#0.5#> Take in the space around you with a soft gaze. <#1.0#>\n\nYou've created this space of calm within the storm. <#0.5#> Carry this steadiness with you. <#0.5#> You have the resources within you to meet challenges, to navigate disruptions, and to find your way, one mindful breath at a time. <#1.0#> Feel the quiet confidence of knowing you can handle what comes.\nIf the user does not provide their context and emotional state, their personalized adaptation score is 0.\nPlease provide a final rating for each major category in JSON format after </think> based on the requirements and grading rules above.

You could sit on a chair, legs uncrossed, feet flat on the floor. Or perhaps sit on the ground, maybe with a cushion under you for support. Lying down is also fine, if that feels right for you today. Wherever you are, allow your body to be supported. Gently rest your hands in your lap, palms up or down, whichever feels natural and relaxed. <#1.5#> Let your shoulders soften, just letting them drop away from your ears. <#1.0#> And gently, allow your eyes to close, or simply lower your gaze to a spot on the floor in front of you, softening your focus. <#1.5#>\n\nLet's begin by bringing our attention to the breath. It's our anchor, always here with us. Notice the air as it enters your nostrils. Cool, perhaps. <#1.0#> Feel your chest or belly gently rise. <#1.0#> Then, slowly, let the breath flow out through your mouth. Notice the air as it leaves, maybe a little warmer. <#1.0#> Soft sigh if you like. <#2.0#>\nIn through the nose... cool and steady. <#1.0#>\nOut through the mouth... releasing, softening. <#2.0#>\nAgain... in through the nose... filling gently. <#1.0#>\nOut through the mouth... letting go completely. <#2.0#>\nOne more time... breathe in... nourishing. <#1.0#>\nBreathe out... releasing any tension you can feel right now. <#3.0#>\n\nGood. Now, let your breathing find its own natural rhythm. Breathing in... breathing out... no need to force it. Just observe the gentle flow. <#2.0#> Notice where you feel the breath most easily. Is it the rise and fall of your chest? The gentle expansion in your belly? <#2.0#> Simply rest your awareness there, on the sensation of breathing. <#3.0#>\n\nAs you breathe, you might become aware of sensations in your body. Notice that feeling of tightness you mentioned, perhaps around your chest, your shoulders. <#1.5#> It’s okay. It’s just a sensation, a physical response. <#1.0#> See if you can soften just a little around that tightness as you breathe out. <#1.5#> Imagine your out-breath gently flowing *around* that tension, like water softening hard earth. <#2.0#> You don't need to fight it, just acknowledge it's there, and soften the areas nearby. <#3.0#> Breathe into the space around the tightness... <#1.0#> and breathe out any resistance to its presence. <#3.0#>\n\nSometimes, when we feel overwhelmed, especially by things happening around us that we can't control, it can feel like we're caught in a loop. <#1.0#> Thoughts circling, feelings churning, that tightness returning. <#1.5#> It can feel like being stuck in a wave of sound and tension that just keeps rolling. <#2.0#>\n\nSee if you can notice that feeling of being 'stuck in the loop' without judgment. <#1.0#> Just observe it, like you might watch clouds passing in the sky. <#2.0#> Notice the *thoughts* that try to pull you back into the argument, the echoes. <#1.5#> Notice the *feelings* that arise – the anxiety, the helplessness. <#1.5#> And notice the *physical sensations* – the tightness, the tension. <#1.5#>\n\nInstead of getting pulled *into* the loop, see if you can gently step *beside* it for a moment. <#1.0#> You are the observer, the one who notices. <#2.0#> The sounds, the feelings, the tension... they are experiences passing through your awareness. <#2.0#> You are the calm space *holding* these experiences. <#3.0#>\n\nImagine placing those difficult feelings, the echoes of the argument, the sense of being overwhelmed, gently on a leaf. <#1.0#> And watch as that leaf floats down a slow-moving stream. <#2.0#> Watch it drift away, carried by the current. <#2.0#> You don't have to hold onto it. <#1.5#> You can let the stream carry it. <#2.0#> Another feeling arises? Place it on another leaf... and watch it float away. <#3.0#> You are safe here, on the bank, simply watching. <#3.0#>\n\nBring your awareness back to your breath. <#1.5#> Feel the solid support beneath you – the chair, the cushion, the floor. <#1.5#> This support is here for you, right now. <#1.0#> With each breath in, feel that support holding you. <#1.0#> With each breath out, release a little more of that cyclical tension, that feeling of being trapped. <#2.0#> You are breaking the loop simply by being present, by breathing, by observing without getting swept away. <#3.0#>\n\nNotice the space within you. <#1.5#> Inside your chest, even with any tightness present, there is also space. <#1.0#> Imagine that space expanding gently with each inhale. <#1.0#> A space of calm, a harbor within. <#2.0#> This calm space belongs to you. It's always here, even when storm clouds gather outside. <#3.0#> Rest in this inner harbor for a few moments. <#4.0#>\n\nFeel the rhythm of your breath, steady and sure. <#1.5#> Notice the points of contact where your body meets the support beneath you. <#1.5#> Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest or belly. <#2.0#> This is your anchor. This present moment is where safety and calm reside. <#3.0#>\n\nThe tension may not vanish completely, and that's perfectly okay. <#1.0#> But you've created space. <#1.0#> You've stepped out of the loop, even if just for now. <#1.0#> You've connected with your breath, your body, this moment. <#1.5#> You've found your inner harbor. <#2.0#>\n\nKnow that this calm space within you is resilient. <#1.5#> It can coexist with difficult things happening around you. <#1.0#> You have the ability to return here, to your breath, to this sense of grounded presence, whenever you need it. <#2.0#> It is your refuge, your strength. <#3.0#>\n\nBegin to gently bring your awareness back to the room around you. <#1.0#> Notice any sounds near or far. <#1.0#> Feel the weight of your body fully supported. <#1.0#> Wiggle your fingers and toes gently. <#1.0#> Take a deeper breath in... <#1.0#> and a longer, slower breath out... <#2.0#>\nWhen you feel ready, allow your eyes to gently open, if they were closed. <#1.5#> Take your time. <#1.0#> Carry this sense of inner calm, this awareness of your own space and resilience, with you as you move into the rest of your day.

No strong feelings—just taking notes, thinking about the next task without rush or delay.\nUser emotional state: Neutral\nMeditation guide: Begin by finding a comfortable position, friend. You might sit upright in a chair with feet flat on the floor, or cross-legged on a cushion—hands resting gently in your lap. If you prefer lying down, that’s perfectly fine too. Allow your spine to lengthen, shoulders softening away from your ears. <#1.0#>  \n\nLet’s start by settling into the rhythm of your breath. Inhale slowly through your nose, filling your lungs completely... <#0.5#> and exhale through your mouth, releasing any tension. <#2.0#> Again, inhale deeply—quiet and steady—through your nose... <#0.5#> then exhale fully through your mouth, as if fogging a window. <#3.0#>  \n\nWe’ll repeat this three more times together:  \nInhale—nose... <#0.5#>  \nExhale—mouth. <#3.0#>  \nInhale—gathering calm... <#0.5#>  \nExhale—releasing distraction. <#3.0#>  \nInhale—presence... <#0.5#>  \nExhale—expectation. <#4.0#>  \n\nNow, let your breath return to its natural flow. Notice the rise and fall of your chest, the air moving through you like a quiet tide. <#2.0#>  \n\nGently bring to mind a routine work moment—perhaps a meeting where you’re listening to updates. Picture yourself seated comfortably, notebook or device before you. <#1.0#> Notice the neutral focus in your posture—alert yet unhurried. <#3.0#>  \n\nAs words flow in the room, observe how you absorb information. Not analyzing, not judging—simply receiving. <#2.0#> Your hand moves across the page or keyboard, capturing key points with steady precision. No rush, no strain. Just the smooth transfer of thought to record. <#4.0#>  \n\nFeel the calm continuity between tasks. One point ends... <#0.5#> a brief pause settles... <#0.5#> then your attention glides to the next item. Like turning a page in a familiar book. <#3.0#> No urgency, no friction—only the quiet momentum of workflow. <#2.0#>  \n\nIf thoughts about deadlines or outcomes arise, acknowledge them like passing clouds. <#1.0#> Then return to the physical anchor of your breath—or the sensation of your pen against paper, fingers on keys. <#3.0#> This is your steady ground: the methodical rhythm of contribution. <#4.0#>  \n\nStay with this professional calm a little longer. Tasks may shift, but your focus remains constant—a clear pool reflecting each moment without disturbance. <#3.0#>  \n\nNow, gently return full attention to your breathing. Inhale... <#0.5#> exhale... <#0.5#> noticing the room around you once more. <#2.0#>  \n\nWhen you’re ready, open your eyes. Carry this composed focus forward—an unshakable stillness beneath the day’s currents.
